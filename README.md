# TNT-Temptation-No-Tempting-
Welcome to TNT ("Temptation No Tempting!"), a JavaScript Application that is going to encourage me with Bible Verses, Songs, and more when I am being tempted. I also hope that this application might be able to help those who are also struggling through temptation of any kind (whether Porn, Alochol, Drugs, etc., though this will mainly be focused on Porn, Lust, and Masturbation and the temptation that comes with that). I also think that the name is awesome, because I didn't know what to call this app and then I typed out "Temptation No Tempting" (based off of Dora) and then I saw the acronym was TNT which is a cool acronym! Anyways, thanks for checking out this repository and this project! God Bless! :D :)
